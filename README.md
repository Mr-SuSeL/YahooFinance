# Python & API
## Financial operations
### Tech stack:
- Python
- Yahoo Finance API
- GUI: tkinter
- plotly
- Selenium

### important notice:
- I have noticed that Ticker.info doesn't work anymore in API v7 in EU. So use VPN US or try fast_info instead
- In new (v4) version of Selenium they changed expression 'driver.find_element_by_xpath()' on: driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"")
  and also You need to import that 'by' in example: 'from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By'. It's new troublemaker stuff
